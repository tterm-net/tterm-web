"""The page and its API, for people.

Everyone signs in (from 0.0.9): the page and its files are open, the API
and the socket answer only within a session, and only about the person's
own projects, machines and terminals. Signing in is under /api/auth, see
core/auth.py.

The built page lives in web/dist. Every path that is not the API or a file of
the page gets index.html, so that addresses inside the page survive a reload.

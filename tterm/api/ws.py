"""The page's one socket: every terminal the page shows goes through it.

The page opens a single WebSocket and attaches terminals to it, each on a
channel number the page picks. Output comes as binary frames, everything
else as JSON text:

    page → core   {"op": "attach", "ch": 1, "id": "<terminal>", "after": 41,
                   "cols": 120, "rows": 40, "focus": true}
                  {"op": "resize", "ch": 1, "cols": 100, "rows": 30}
                  {"op": "focus" | "pause" | "resume" | "detach" | "close",
                   "ch": 1}
                  {"op": "run", "ch": 1, "command": "ls -la",
                   "confirmed": false}
                  binary: 0x02, channel (4 bytes), keystrokes
    core → page   {"op": "attached", "ch": 1, "terminal": {...}, "resumed": true}
                  {"op": "reset", "ch": 1, "seq": 40}   then a full replay,
                  {"op": "replayed", "ch": 1, "seq": 97}  and its end
                  {"op": "ev", "ch": 1, "seq": 52, "t": "P" | "C", ...}
                  {"op": "state", "ch": 1, "terminal": {...}}
                  {"op": "gone", "ch": 1, "terminal": {...} | null}
                  {"op": "confirm", "ch": 1, "command": "...", "what": "...",
                   "lost": "...", "everything": false}
                  {"op": "refused", "ch": 1, "command": "...", "reason": "..."}
                  {"op": "error", "message": "..."}
                  binary: 0x01, channel (4 bytes), number (8 bytes), output

"after" is the number of the last output the page has; the core sends what
follows, or, if that is no longer kept or the page has nothing, a reset and
everything kept. The page pauses a channel when it has more on its hands
than it can draw, and resumes it when it catches up. "focus" makes this
page the one that types into the terminal (see Watcher).

"run" is a whole command from tTerm's own input line. A command that would
do damage nothing brings back is first answered with "confirm"; the page
asks, and sends it again with "confirmed". A command the shell cannot take
now (another one is running) is answered with "refused".

The socket belongs to a session (see core/auth.py) and shows only that
person's terminals. When the session ends, the socket closes with the code
SIGNED_OUT_CLOSE and the page asks to sign in: at once on Sign out, Forget
all devices or a forgotten device, otherwise within a minute. Keys typed and
commands run count as something done, and keep the session from ending.

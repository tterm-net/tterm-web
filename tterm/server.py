"""The core as a running thing: the database, the page, the machines' side.

Two listeners, as on the server with its two addresses: the page and its API
for people, and the side machines talk to. They are separate apps on
separate ports, so the tunnel, which points at the machines' port, cannot
lead anyone to the page. The signer is a separate process; the core only
talks to it.

Everyone signs in (from 0.0.9). On the laptop the person it belongs to is
the local owner, as before, once TTERM_OWNER_EMAIL gives them an address.

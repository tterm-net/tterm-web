"""The log of a machine (0.1.20): what was run on it through tTerm, a day
at a time, with notes under the lines.

Every command a terminal runs is a line of the journal, `command.ran`,
written with its block and in the same transaction (terminals.py,
_save_block): when it started, who ran it, how it ended, how long it took
and where. Its words are kept beside the journal, in log_texts; the journal
row keeps their fingerprint, salted. Terminals opened and ended are lines
of the log too (`terminal.opened`, `terminal.closed`).

Under a line, notes (`log.note`), by a person or by an AI on a person's
behalf: the AI then may do no more than that person may. What is written
is never changed or taken back; a note is answered with another. Everyone
in the project reads the log, the owner, admins and members write notes,
an observer only reads.

The log is the machine's (0.1.23): whoever is in the project the machine is
in now reads all of it, writes under it and redacts in it as their role
there says, whichever project a line was written in. A machine moved to
another project takes its log along, and the old project keeps none of it:
deleting it takes none of it away. The move is a line of the log too.

A password or a token that got into a command or a note is redacted by the
project's owner or an admin (`log.redacted`): its words go for good, from
the log, the terminal's feed and search, with what the command printed,
and the log keeps who redacted it, when and why.

Lines are kept as long as the project keeps its journal (a year), what the
commands printed as long as it keeps output (30 days). A note and a
redaction leave with their line.

From 0.1.21 a log is looked through as well: Find in this log, over all the
days it keeps (`find`), and search over the logs of every machine the
person reads (`found_in_logs`, for search.py). What a command printed opens
under its line, from its block, while the block is kept: a line says so,
and the width the command ran at.

"""Notes: what a project writes down, in folders (from 0.1.0).

A note is a title and a list of blocks: a paragraph, a heading, a list item,
a checklist item, code, and a divider. The page turns Markdown into blocks
as it is typed; the core keeps them as JSON, and the page always shows them
as text, never as HTML, so nothing written in a note can run on the page.

Notes live in folders the way terminals live on machines, and a folder
belongs to one project: everyone in the project reads and writes its notes,
an observer only reads them. A note is deleted by its author, the owner and
admins; a folder, with the notes in it, by the owner and admins, and by
whoever made it while it is empty.

The same note written on two devices: every save names the version it was
made from, and one made from an older version is merged with what was saved
since, block by block. Changes to different blocks both stay; the same block
changed both ways is a conflict, and the page asks whose to keep. A tick in
a checklist is a change of its own, made at once: who ticked and when come
from the core, never from the page.

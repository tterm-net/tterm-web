"""Terminals: real shells on machines, kept by the core, shown by pages.

A terminal lives in the core, not in the browser. Closing or reloading the
page leaves the shell, and whatever runs in it, alone; the page comes back
and takes up where it was. Only the shell's own end, or the core stopping,
ends a terminal.

Everything a terminal sends is numbered: each piece of output and each
marker gets the next number. The core keeps the last few megabytes, so a
page that lost its connection for a moment asks for everything after the
last number it has and the screen goes on as if nothing happened. A page
that comes back empty, after a reload, gets all that is kept, drawn again
from a clean screen; a full-screen program is then asked to redraw itself.

Each command becomes a block in the database: its text, the directory and
branch it ran in, how long it took, how it ended, and its output, compressed,
the beginning and the end of it if it was long.

From 0.0.5 the page can also type a whole command at the prompt (run), and
ask the machine, over a quiet side channel of the same SSH connection, what
a word under Tab can become and which directories and branches there are.

From 0.0.6 a terminal can be on a computer too, through its agent instead of
SSH; the terminal does it all the same way over either (see transport.py).

From 0.0.7 a computer's terminal waits for its agent when the agent goes
(the laptop sleeps, the network blinks): it stays open, away, takes no keys
meanwhile, and goes on where it was when the agent is back.

From 0.1.24 a terminal that a release of tTerm Web ended says so: "tTerm Web
was updated to 0.1.24." instead of "tTerm Web stopped.", on its tab and in
its machine's log; and Open a new terminal there starts in the folder it
was in.

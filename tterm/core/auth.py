"""Signing in: a code from email, then, on a device the person trusts, a
four-digit code for quick sign-in. Open to everyone: an address without an
account gets one after its first code that works.

    1. The page asks for a code for an address. Six digits go there by
       email; they work for ten minutes, five tries, and only in the browser
       that asked (its own cookie, BROWSER_COOKIE): a code read out to
       someone over the phone is no use in their browser.
    2. The code signs the person in. For an address without an account it
       does not yet: first the person gives their name and accepts the
       Terms of Service, having read the Privacy Policy (sign_up), in the same
       browser within half an hour.
    3. Right after, the page offers a quick code for this device; "Not now"
       leaves the browser a stranger, and next time it is email again.
    4. A quick code makes the browser a device: a long random key the
       browser keeps (DEVICE_COOKIE) and, here, its hash and the quick
       code's. The quick code works only with that key, so it is no use
       anywhere else; five wrong ones and the device is forgotten, and it
       is email again.

A session is a cookie as well (SESSION_COOKIE). It ends after eight hours
without anything done, on Sign out, or with its device. Only hashes are
kept: of the random tokens plainly, of the codes and the quick codes with a
secret of this server's that never goes to the database (`auth.key` in the
data folder), so that a copy of the database alone guesses nothing.

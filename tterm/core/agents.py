"""Computers: the agent that dials in (from 0.0.6, with agent 0.11.0).

A laptop cannot be reached from outside: it has no stable address, it sits
behind NAT and it sleeps. So the direction is reversed: the agent opens a
WebSocket to the machines' side, /agent, and keeps it open. Every terminal
on that computer goes through that one connection.

The agent stays a pipe: it starts what it is asked to in a pseudo-terminal
and passes the bytes both ways, and it runs the small sh scripts it is
sent. The markers, the blocks and everything else live here, as for a
server, so the agent rarely needs a new version.

How a computer joins. Add a machine, then Computer, gives a command with a
token that works for ten minutes. The agent, started with it, says hello;
the core takes the token, reads the computer's passport through the agent,
and from then on the same token is that computer's key: only its hash is
kept, with the machine, and the agent signs in with it every time.

The protocol, all of it on the one WebSocket (web 1):

    agent → core  text   hello {token, name, user, os, agent, shell, web}
    core → agent  text   welcome {name}, or error {error, revoked}
    core → agent  text   open {ch, cmd, cols, rows, echo}, size {ch, cols,
                         rows}, close {ch}, run {id, script, timeout}, hb,
                         ping
    core → agent  bytes  2, the channel in 4 bytes, keys
    agent → core  bytes  1, the channel in 4 bytes, output
    agent → core  text   exit {ch, code, error}, ran {id, code, out, err},
                         hb, pong

From agent 0.12.0 (web 2) a computer's terminals outlive the connection:
the laptop sleeps, the network blinks, the agent keeps its shells and the
core keeps the terminals, away, until it is back. The hello then says which
shells it kept, and the core takes each back from the byte it has:

    agent → core  text   hello {…, kept: [ch, …]}
    core → agent  text   resume {ch, from}; the shells it no longer has a
                         terminal for get a close
    agent → core  text   gap {ch, lost}: output no longer kept, skipped;
                         exit {ch, gone: true}: no such shell any more;
                         bye: stopped on purpose, its shells end with it

From 0.0.8 a computer is added with an installer (agent 0.13.0 or newer),
which makes the computer a key of its own and keeps it in ~/.tterm-web:

    agent → core  text   hello {…, token, key}: the token from Add a
                         machine lets it join, once; the key is what the
                         computer is known by from then on. Run again, the
                         installer keeps the key: the computer is the same
                         one, and the new token only tells the dialog so.

A computer removed in tTerm Web hears it on the spot:

    core → agent  text   error {error, revoked: true}, then the connection
                         closes; the agent stops and does not come back.

The Telegram bot speaks an older form of it to the same agent; the agent
tells the two apart by what it is sent.

/agent is open to the internet, so what a stranger can make it do is
bounded: a hello is small and comes at once, only so many connections from
one address may wait to say it, and when too many wait in all the oldest
goes; an address whose hellos keep failing waits, except for computers it
already has; a message is never larger than a script's answer.

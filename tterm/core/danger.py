"""Commands worth asking about twice.

The same small set the Telegram bot holds back, for the same reasons. A
command typed into tTerm's own input line can come from history, from a
suggestion accepted with one key, or from "Run again" on an old block, and
the terminal it lands in is not always the one you think you are looking at.

The set is deliberately small: a terminal that asks about everything trains
people to confirm without reading, which is worse than not asking at all.

What qualifies: the damage is immediate, and nothing brings it back. Deleting
a file tree, wiping a disk, dropping a database, cutting the machine off the
network. Not `git reset --hard`: unpleasant, but the work is usually still
somewhere. Not `rm file.txt`: one file, named deliberately.

In the classic mode keys go straight to the shell and nothing is checked;
the page says so.

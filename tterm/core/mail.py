"""Email: the codes for signing in, and the note about a sign-in from a
device tTerm Web does not know. What they say and how they look: letters.py.

On the server it goes out through Brevo's API (TTERM_BREVO_KEY), as HTML
with the plain text beside it (from 0.0.11). Without a key, as on the
laptop, each email goes to the log instead, its text, code and all, so that
signing in works there too; the checks read what was "sent" from the same
place.

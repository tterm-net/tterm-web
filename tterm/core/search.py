"""Search over everything (0.1.7): the core's part of it.

The palette (Cmd+K) finds terminals, machines, projects and things to do on
the page itself, which has them all. What only the core has is here: every
command of every terminal of the person's, ended ones too, as long as its
project keeps output (output_days); what those commands printed; and notes,
whole, in the projects the person is in.

A query is words: each must be there, in any order and any case, and a word
may sit inside another (`cert` finds `certbot`). The page ranks what comes
back and draws it.

What a command printed is kept compressed, escape sequences and all. Search
reads a copy of it as plain text, the start and the end of a long one
(`plain`), made when the block is saved. Blocks saved before 0.1.7 get
theirs in the background, a few hundred at a time (`fill_texts`).

"""How a terminal reaches its machine: over SSH to a server, or through the
agent on a computer (from 0.0.6).

A terminal does not care which. Over both it starts its shell in a terminal
of the page's size, types into it, reads what it prints, resizes it, and
asks the machine small sh scripts on the side: the shell scripts going into
~/.tterm before the shell starts, Tab, the lists of directories and branches.

A server gets an SSH connection of its own for each terminal. A computer
has one agent connection for all of them (see agents.py); ending a terminal
there ends its shell, never the connection. From 0.0.7 a computer's
terminals outlive that connection too: they wait, away, for the agent to
come back, and go on over its next one.

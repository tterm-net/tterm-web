// The page inside tTerm for the computer before signing in (from 0.1.4),

// browser the page is always signed in. Before signing in there is this
// computer only: Personal with it and its terminals; the account at the
// bottom of the sidebar says Not signed in, and its menu has Settings and
// Sign in. New project and Add machine are there as after signing in, and
// from 0.1.5 say what signing in brings (canvas of 22.10, version 65;
// NeedAccount.tsx).
//
// From 0.1.6 the app signs in with the browser (AppSignIn.tsx, Connect.tsx).
// Signed in, its engine says "app": true and marks the computer it runs on
// "here", as on the canvas of 23.10 (version 70, variant B): only that
// computer is marked, on an amber square and with "this Mac", in the
// sidebar and on its tabs; everything else looks as in the browser. Without
// the connection ("offline") a strip says so and the cloud's machines wait.

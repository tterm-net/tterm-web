// A note in its tab: where it lives, its title, who wrote it, and its
// blocks to write in. Every change is saved a moment after typing stops,
// naming the version it was made from; what others saved meanwhile is
// merged in, and only the same place changed two ways asks whose to keep
// there. While the tab is in front, the page looks again now and then for
// what others wrote. Like terminals, every open note stays on the page
// behind its tab, so that switching keeps the caret and the scroll.
//
// What is typed and not saved yet is kept in this browser as a draft until
// it is (drafts.ts): opening the note again brings it back, merged with
// what was saved since.
